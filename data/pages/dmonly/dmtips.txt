===== Angry GM: Campaign Tips =====


  * Now, this doesn’t have to be particularly detailed. I’ve started many campaigns off by saying “this is a campaign about saving the world from evil” or “defeating an evil force” or “preventing a disaster.” “At some point, early in the campaign, you will begin to learn the details of a terrible threat or evil empire or something. You are, for whatever reason, the only group strong enough, brave enough, and/or destined enough to stop it. Make a character who is willing to risk everything to save the world, cool?”
  * That sort of opening can start off everything from Star Wars to Lord of the Rings and it doesn’t give any of the mystery away. But it does tell the players WHY their characters are together. It provides them a common motivation. And they can think about the sort of character they might play. You’re not likely to get a greedy, selfish thief. Instead, you’ll get the jerka&% scoundrel with a heart of gold (Han Solo). And if you DO get the greedy, selfish thief, you can tell the player that it won’t work and explain why.
  * Common motivation campaigns tend to hold together pretty well by their nature because most conflicts can be resolved simply by agreeing on which choice leads to the most of whatever the party agrees they all want. Most of the conflicts that do occur are about what lines can and can’t be crossed to get the thing. Remember, you don’t want NO conflict. You just want something that provides a strong, common goal so conflicts CAN be resolved without turning into festering, ongoing resentments.
  * An employer or organization is just a way of creating an external common motivation or common means. And that makes it stronger. It also means that, when a conflict does threaten to pull the party apart, the GM has a way to get into the conflict before it spills from characters to players. And, because everybody agreed at the start of the campaign to be part of the organization, it also reinforces the GM’s authority to enforce the campaign’s glue.
  * Action focused or cerebral? “World spanning or focused on a home base? Adventure of the week or ongoing plot? Epic battle against evil or complex morality play? Optimistic or nihilistic? How much freedom do you give the players to create their own stories in the world? Are the gods important? Is your game challenging? Can the players lose the campaign?
  * If you’re running an infrequent game, you have to learn to keep the pace up, to stay focused, and to cut your game down into manageable chunks that fit into single sessions. And complex, multi-adventure plot-arcs need to be simple if they exist at all. No long cons. No complex world building. No sandbox crap. And cut out as much non-game s$&% as possible. In short, if you’re stuck with an infrequent game, you’re probably going to be limited to an adventure-of-the-week style “plate of meatballs” game.
  * Tone – the GENERAL mood and feel of the game – is also something that doesn’t often get explicitly chosen. But it should be. Because tone determines a lot about what will be tolerated in the game and what will break the game. There’s a big difference between the epic, high-fantasy adventure of the Lord of the Rings and the gritty, character-driven, political fantasy of Game of Thrones. 
  * As a side note, don’t try to talk to anyone directly about their engagements or the engagements of the game. It doesn’t work that way. The best way to confirm someone’s engagements is to use specific examples. Don’t say, “you seem to dig discovery, is that true?” Instead, say, “you’re the sort of person who found every collectible in the Doom reboot, aren’t you?” Remember, people are good at knowing what they like, bad at predicting what they will like, and terrible at explaining any of it. Give them something specific to like.
  * There are three basic kinds of plot points you can use to pad your plots.
    * Checkpoints are plot points that represent intermediate steps toward the larger goal. Each checkpoint brings the party closer to whatever goal they are pursuing. They are steps in the process.Basically, they are points through which the plot must pass to succeed.nd a well-run campaign will offer the players a chance to make up for a failure by allowing them to find another way to succeed. And, this is where padding on the fly will be extremely important.
    * Obstacles are plot points that just get in the party’s way. Unlike checkpoints which are plot points through which the party must pass to move closer to their goal, obstacles merely prevent the party from moving toward their goal. If the party deals successfully with an obstacle, they aren’t really any closer to their goals. But if they fail to deal with an obstacle, they suffer some sort of setback or consequence. Now, it’s important to note that obstacles do not have to be failure points. For that matter, neither do checkpoints. But, to qualify as a plot point, something in the story must change because of the party’s successes or failures. Or both. A checkpoint represents a change to the story because the players cannot succeed until they have dealt with the checkpoint. That’s a pretty big change. An obstacle represents a change because the players are very likely to succeed until the obstacle confounds them. But good plot points provide more turns than merely “you can’t continue your adventures until you do this” or “you did this so now you can continue your adventure.” 
    *  Diversions represent side quests. They represent departures from the main story. Like checkpoints and obstacles, diversions must have an impact on the plot. But their impact isn’t necessarily tied directly to the party’s primary goal. The Sword of Winning makes the party more powerful in general. It will certainly sway their final battle against Shrub Niggurath, but only in a tangential way.
  * “An adventure is the smallest segment of a role-playing game that can be considered a complete and satisfying story.”
  * But notice that that decision doesn’t mean anything by itself. Even though it is the core of the RPG experience, the decision, by itself, doesn’t actually make any sense. It’s naked.
  * Decisions fit into actions. Actions give decisions context. When the player says “I choose to go left so that I can catch up with the goblin,” suddenly, we understand the decision.
  *  An adventure is a container for encounters and it provides the encounters context. It gives them meaning. It keeps all of your encounters and actions and choices from running around naked.
  * First, there’s the beatbox campaign. You know: “hub-and-spokes-and- hub-and-spokes-and-hub…” In a beatbox campaign, the players tend to travel from one home base to the next. At each, they settle down for a while, do a bunch of adventures, get attached to the location, get to know the people, get immersed, and then they move on to the next home base and do it all again. This is very much how World of Warcraft is structured. The players get to experience big, new places every so often, but they also get to get immersed and attached to those places. For plot- and character- campaigns, each location generally has a plot arc running through it that links all or most of the adventures. Once that plot is resolved, the heroes learn about some other location that has a new plot arc or else the resolved plot thread leaves a loose end that draws the heroes to the next location. For more quest driven campaigns and “adventure of the week” style games, the transition from one location to the next is generally driven by the players’ power levels. In fact, the beatbox campaign is an excellent way to create a campaign with the feeling of an open-world, exploration-based sandbox but still maintain a good challenge and level progression. In each location, the heroes grow from small fish to big fish until they finally head off to look for a new, bigger pond.

Terrain is just another encounter. Imagine not in graph paper, but in blobs. Blobs made out of:

  * **Walls and Other __Obstructions__:**  This is a bit of terrain that says “none shall pass.” You can’t walk through it, you can’t see through it, you can’t shoot through it. It is just in the f$&%ing way in every sense of the word. They force people to move around them. But people can also use the corners for cover. In general, ranged combatants hate walls, but love corners of walls. But also, outnumbered parties love lots of walls because they can keep themselves from getting surrounding.
  * **Statues, Pillars, Trees, Boulders, and Other __Cover__:** Cover is basically just Smaller Obstruction.
  * **Chokepoints and Funnels:** Places on the battlefield where all the traffic, all the movement, all the lines of sight have to pass through a very small area. A doorway is a perfect example of a chokepoint. Chokepoints allow for a lot of power, a lot of control. A group that controls a chokepoint limits how the enemies can move and target others, but they also end up limiting themselves.
  * **Fogs, Shrouds, Darkness, and __Obscurement__:**  It is anything that blocks or impedes line of sight based on position, but doesn’t block movement. It can lay over the entire battlefield (darkness or fog, for example) or it might be limited to specific areas (like vines, curtains, the smoke from a bonfire, or the thick vapor rising from fumaroles and boiling mudpots). In general, obscurement makes life more difficult for ranged combatants and makes life easier for the targets of ranged attacks (e.g.: the melee combatants).
  * **Pits, Ravines, Rivers, Chasms, Barricades, Portcullises, Arrow Slits, and Other __Ground Obstacles__: ** A ground obstacle is anything that impedes or prevents movement but doesn’t block line of sight. Ranged combatants love them but melee combatants hate them.  They permit ranged attacks while preventing movement.
  * **Fire, Lava, Boiling Mud, Acid, Stinging Vines, Swinging Axe Blades, and __Hazards__:** Hazards are nasty pieces of terrain. They may or may not impede line of sight, but otherwise they function kind of like soft obstructions. Most of the time, a hazard is just a wall or ground obstacle, but a brave creature can decide to move through the wall or obstacle at a risk or cost.
  * **__Booby Traps__:** A good booby trap is an //invisible piece of terrain//. A clever foe may try to draw a strong melee combatant into the booby trap. But after the trap goes off, there’s a new piece of terrain, a ground obstacle, a pit. And it continues to affect the battle just like any obstacle would. On the other hand, imagine a trap that fires and then never does anything else to shape the battle. That’s just an invisible screwjob.
  * **Rubble, Broken Floors, Waist Deep Water, Thick Mud, Underbrush, and Other __Impeding Terrain__ :** Terrain that has no other effect except to slow someone down. Mobile characters and melee combatants hate impeding terrain because it makes movement harder. Ranged characters love it because what it really is is distance that doesn’t change ranges.
  * **Tables, Chairs, Crates, Barrels, Chandeliers, Amphoras, Altars, and Other __Props__ :** Props like barrels and braziers and campfires are tough to classify. The reason is because they are variable. Props are fun because (a) give some flavor to the battlefield and (b) let players and creatures be creative and do interesting things with whatever is at hand. Any given prop could potentially give an advantage to anyone creative enough to take advantage of it.
  * **__Distance:__** Distance is a terrain feature. Distance buys everyone time before the melee combatants can wade into the fight. During that time, ranged fighters can do their thing and punish the enemy, characters can find defensive positions to hold, creatures can claim terrain features like chokepoints, or they can use their time to power themselves up using defensive and buffing spells.
  * **__Open Space:__** In general, tight, constrained spaces make life easier for whichever side has fewer combatants. Open spaces serve the group that has a numerical advantage well. Because the group with more creatures can more easily outmaneuver the other. They can outflank, they can surround, they can spread out among multiple targets. Tight, limit mobility the group with greater numbers ends up bumping into itself and tripping over itself. Of course, open space is useful for ranged combatants, but it can be a mixed blessing because it also makes it easier for enemies to close with them.
